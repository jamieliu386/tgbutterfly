I added another button to the Assignment_One_Scene tab (bound to g). This button adds (or removes)
small box feet to the ends of the butterfly's legs. This was added as an extra distinguishing feature
for fun. 

As a side note, the butterfly is centered at the world origin but the camera must be moved back in
order to fully view it.
